# Manage Dependencies with NPM

- Create a `package.json` file in this folder
    - npm init -y
- Add `"type": "module"` to the `package.json` file
    - This will allow us to use `import` and `export`
- Create a file called `index.js` 
    - Import at least 3 functions from the `date-fns` library
        - See the `date-fns` [website](https://date-fns.org/) for more information
    - Use / call those 3 functions
